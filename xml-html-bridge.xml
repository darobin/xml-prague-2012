            Robin has spent the better part of this decade working on standards for a variety of Web
            and XML technologies, mostly within the W3C. He has served as author or editor for more 
            than a dozen W3C standards, has chaired multiple groups working on XML optimisation and 
            Web APIs, and has recently been elected to the TAG. He also hacks on Javascript stuff
            a lot. In his copious spare time he reads, writes, and gets bitten by his cat.

      <para>
        W3C created a small Task Force to look at convergence paths
        between XML and HTML. One of the notions that it discussed was that
        the two technologies could perhaps not be aligned, but that they could
        cross-pollinate.
      </para>
      <para>
        This talk will look at ways for this to happen. Can we use CSS
        Selectors in XPointer? Can we build something like XSLT using
        CSS + JavaScript and another syntax? Does HTML actually have some interesting
        approaches to distributed extensibility? Should SVG be in the HTML namespace 
        and has it suffered from changing its syntax?

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Over a year ago, the W3C put together a small XML-HTML Task Force that was asked to look
      into the convergence between these two technology families. This paper is derived from the
      experience of two of the task force's participants in looking at the two ecosystems in order
      to figure out what they could share.
    </para>
    <para>
      While it appears that complete alignment between the HTML and XML families may not be 
      achievable (or in fact desirable), there are nevertheless areas in which cross-pollination
      between those two stacks could help improve either or both. Despite the important design differences
      that exist between HTML and XML, their goals are not as divided as some of the stormier rhetoric 
      suggests. There are plenty of areas of common experience despite significant differences in the 
      details.
    </para>
    <para>
      This paper will therefore navigate a number of cross-over options. Some of these work today
      but may not be in common use, at times because they could in fact be detrimental, but in a number of
      cases possibly because they have been overlooked by those who could benefit from them. Other parts
      may not work because of a technological gap. Yet others may seem no less than utter madness, but 
      could nevertheless constitute an interesting avenue for exploration.
