            Robin has spent the better part of this decade working on standards for a variety of Web
            and XML technologies, mostly within the W3C. He has served as author or editor for more 
            than a dozen W3C standards, has chaired multiple groups working on XML optimisation and 
            Web APIs, and has recently been elected to the TAG. He also hacks on Javascript stuff
            a lot. In his copious spare time he reads, writes, and gets bitten by his cat.
