            Robin has spent the better part of this decade working on standards for a variety of Web
            and XML technologies, mostly within the W3C. He has served as author or editor for more 
            than a dozen W3C standards, has chaired multiple groups working on XML optimisation and 
            Web APIs, and has recently been elected to the TAG. He also hacks on Javascript stuff
            a lot. In his copious spare time he reads, writes, and gets bitten by his cat.

    LIST (try to organise this a little):
    * XML + CSS (which mostly works, I think)
    * XML + CSS + JS (which mostly doesn't, I think)
    * <?xml-script?>
    * XLink unsupported
    * SVG is special cased
    * A CSS selector-based XPointer scheme (Simon)
    * XForms?
    * Accessibility of XML over the wire?
    * What's missing from CSS to do FO?
    * JavaScript for page-formatting?
    * Something about Web Components (fka XBL)?
    * Can we build XSLT using CSS+JavaScript syntax
        (What does that mean?)
    * Are the HTML approaches to distributed extensibility better than
     those which the XML community designed but never used?
        (What does that mean?)
    * Compilation to JavaScript (Saxon CE, Vojtech's XProc GWT project)
    * CSS Schema
    * Should SVG be in the HTML namespace and has it suffered from changing its syntax?
