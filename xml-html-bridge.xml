            Robin has spent the better part of this decade working on standards for a variety of Web
            and XML technologies, mostly within the W3C. He has served as author or editor for more 
            than a dozen W3C standards, has chaired multiple groups working on XML optimisation and 
            Web APIs, and has recently been elected to the TAG. He also hacks on Javascript stuff
            a lot. In his copious spare time he reads, writes, and gets bitten by his cat.

    <abstract>
      <para>
        W3C created a small Task Force to look at convergence paths
        between XML and HTML. One of the notions that it discussed was that
        the two technologies could perhaps not be aligned, but that they could
        cross-pollinate.
      </para>
      <para>
        This talk will look at ways for this to happen. Can we use CSS
        Selectors in XPointer? Can we build something like XSLT using
        CSS + JavaScript and another syntax? Does HTML actually have some interesting
        approaches to distributed extensibility? Should SVG be in the HTML namespace 
        and has it suffered from changing its syntax?
