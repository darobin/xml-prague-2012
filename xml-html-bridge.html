        W3C created a small Task Force to look at convergence paths
        between XML and HTML. One of the notions that it discussed was that
        the two technologies could perhaps not be aligned, but that they could
        cross-pollinate.
      </p><p>
        This talk will look at ways for this to happen. Can we use CSS
        Selectors in XPointer? Can we build something like XSLT using
        CSS + JavaScript and another syntax? Does HTML actually have some interesting
        approaches to distributed extensibility? Should SVG be in the HTML namespace 
        and has it suffered from changing its syntax?

      Over a year ago, the W3C put together a small XML-HTML Task Force that was asked to look
      into the convergence between these two technology families. This paper is derived from the
      experience of two of the task force's participants in looking at the two ecosystems in order
      to figure out what they could share.
    </p><p>
      While it appears that complete alignment between the HTML and XML families may not be 
      achievable (or in fact desirable), there are nevertheless areas in which cross-pollination
      between those two stacks could help improve either or both. Despite the important design differences
      that exist between HTML and XML, their goals are not as divided as some of the stormier rhetoric 
      suggests. There are plenty of areas of common experience despite significant differences in the 
      details.
    </p><p>
      This paper will therefore navigate a number of cross-over options. Some of these work today
      but may not be in common use, at times because they could in fact be detrimental, but in a number of
      cases possibly because they have been overlooked by those who could benefit from them. Other parts
      may not work because of a technological gap. Yet others may seem no less than utter madness, but 
      could nevertheless constitute an interesting avenue for exploration.

        SVG was born and raised an XML language. It has its own namespace fully defined with a proper
        namespace document. It has a RelaxNG as well as an NVDL schema; in fact at one point or another
        it has even had a DTD and an XML Schema. It uses XLink, and version 1.2 even adopted <code class="code">xml:id</code>.
        Over the years it has routinely been both consumed and produced using XSLT and XPath; for a while
        there even was a project to add “<span class="quote">SVG Extensions to XPath</span>” in order to process its geometry
        better.
      </p><p>
        This is interesting because it is not all that common for graphics people to care, or even know much 
        about, XML. A large part of the reason for it to use XML in the first place was because it was intended
        to be embedded straight into XHTML, or of course any other XML language that could use some pretty
        shapes.
      </p><p>
        But with XHTML pining for the fjords, the question of what to do with SVG became rather acute. Browsers
        already largely supported it, so that there was little point in dropping it entirely. Besides, there
        was no proposed replacement and starting from scratch would have taken too long. The decision was
        therefore made to find a way to integrate it with HTML.
      </p><p>
        By and large, given that several of the important integration factors had already been figured out
        for XHTML integration and did not need to be updated, considering the size and complexity of SVG
        this turned out to be a lot easier than one may expect. However, the matter of syntax remained a problem.
        Keeping the XML syntax created trouble at the HTML parsing level since one would have to switch parsers.
        What's more, embedding different syntaxes that are mostly the same but also subtly different inside
        one another is hardly the friendly thing to do to developers. After some intense debate, the decision
        was made to accept the transition of SVG to the HTML syntax, along with other niceties like automatic
        namespacing.
      </p><p>
        A number of participants in this discussion predicted trouble from this switch, notably due to cut and
        paste errors. In practice, now several years after the switch took place, very few complaints have been
        heard. On the contrary, the merged syntax has made it easier to better support SVG on the Web, and SVG
        is increasingly becoming mainstream thanks to that and the common usage of libraries that make use
        of this facility such as Raphaël. In fact it is such a success that the SVG WG is considering dropping
        SVG's own namespace entirely and automatically coercing it all into the HTML namespace, one way or another.
      </p><p>
        An interesting open question here is whether there are other languages that could be given the same
        treatment.
      </p></div><div class="section" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="web-components"/>Distributed Extensibility on the Web</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Much discussion has surrounded a property of “Distributed Extensibility” that XML is supposedly
        endowed with (by virtue of namespaces) when HTML is not. But is that concern justified?
      </p><p>
        The first thing to note is that saying that XML supports distributed extensibility is not a very
        useful statement to make. XML is just a syntax, and if you couldn't freely create languages with
        it it's not clear what it would be useful for. A more precise characterisation is that, given
        that namespaces can be used to mix vocabularies, XML <span class="emphasis"><em>languages</em></span> support distributed
        extensibility. Anyone can grab an XML document that uses a given language, slap an extra namespace
        declaration, and start injecting attributes and elements from a different language without hurting
        the first.
      </p><p>
        The ability to extend a language independently of the agent that controls it is a very powerful and 
        seductive one. However, in order for it to be genuinely useful, you need more than extensibility at
        the syntactical and semantic level. You also need the same extensibility to be at the very least
        harmless through most of the processing chain that is applied to the original language.
      </p><p>
        And that's where things start becoming less clear for distributed extensibility in the XML ecosystem.
        While building a processing tool chain that supports distributed extensibility in XML is technically
        possible, drove after drove of users have voted with their feet against it. In order to support DE,
        one would expect a schema language to accept by default namespaces that it is not aware of, yet the
        most popular choices in this area — XML Schema and RelaxNG — make this difficult. There is very little
        in the way of tooling support for manipulating trees that may compose multiple namespaces together
        while easily the ones that are not expected to be present. And in practice, code is rarely written
        with that expectation in mind. Try throwing in additional namespaced elements into a DOM, SAX, XSLT, etc. processing
        pipeline and the chances are high that you will see it fail.
      </p><p>
        A number of best practices were initially worked on (in part in order to support versioning) that described
        useful rules for ignoring content from distributed extensibility, but there was never sufficient
        interest to finalise them. A technology like NVDL could prove helpful in a DE-enabled tool chain but
        it is hardly ever used — in fact the vast majority of XML users are likely never to have heard of it.
        RDDL (and namespace documents in general) which could make DE additionally useful by building discoverability
        into the system barely elicited sufficient interest to foster a few short-lived proposals.
      </p><p>
        It is therefore fair to say that while distributed extensibility was part of the initial XML vision, in practice
        it failed to see the light of day.
      </p><p>
        Meanwhile, work has progressed on a promising new HTML-based technology called
        <a class="link" href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/shadow/index.html" target="">Web Components</a>.
        Geared towards interactive documents, it makes it possible to decorate an existing document with
        any number of “shadow DOMs” that can hang off its elements, and can themselves contain further shadow DOMs
        recursively. The current work is still in its infancy, but it has roots in previous work called XBL which
        served a similar purpose in a different fashion.
      </p><p>
        The great value of shadow DOMs is that they make it possible to process independent yet composed document trees
        without any risk of seeing their processing chains step on one another's toes. It is too early to know if they
        could be transposed to batch operations easily or if that approach would even be workable in an XML context,
        but it's a space worth watching. It might just happen that the XML ecosystem could import concepts from
        Web Components in order to develop its own support for distributed extensibility.

        The Javascript community is presently seeing a small cottage industry in the production of templating 
        languages. In fact, there are days on which one may get the impression that you can't be a proper
        Javascript developer if you haven't released your own templating language to GitHub.
      </p><p>
        String-interpolation templating languages are great when you need to generate HTML from a rather straightforward
        data structure, but they start to become cumbersome when your input increases in complexity, especially if
        it's a document itself.
      </p><p>
        For that, XSLT is currently king. But try as you might, getting your typical web hacker to even think about
        perhaps using it is nigh impossible. Back in 1998, a submission called 
        <a class="link" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-STTS3" target="">STTS</a> was made to the W3C. It used a CSS based declarative
        language to transform documents (primarily HTML back then), but never met with strong support. Re-evaluating it
        in today's context, it is interesting to note that it bears some similarities with the now popular 
        <a class="link" href="http://haml-lang.com/" target="">HAML</a> templating language. That being said, its highly declarative
        nature is likely to make it only slightly more popular than XSLT with this crowd.
      </p><p>
        Would it be possible to implement a language or library built on the principles that make XSLT a great language
        but using an approach that would be familiar to Web developers? Reimplementing the full feature-set of an
        XSLT processor is not a minor undertaking, but a decent amount of it can be handled if we have JavaScript
        handy. Besides, since this is just a thought experiment at this point, we can probably stick to only porting
        XSLT's core processing model and see how far that gets us. That is a much smaller endeavour, in fact the
        XSLT processing model is so elegantly short that we can simply reproduce it here from the specification in
        its unabridged entirety:
      </p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"><p>
          A list of source nodes is processed to create a result tree fragment. The result tree is constructed by 
          processing a list containing just the root node. A list of source nodes is processed by appending the 
          result tree structure created by processing each of the members of the list in order. A node is processed 
          by finding all the template rules with patterns that match the node, and choosing the best amongst them; 
          the chosen rule's template is then instantiated with the node as the current node and with the list of 
          source nodes as the current node list. A template typically contains instructions that select an additional 
          list of source nodes for processing. The process of matching, instantiation and selection is continued 
          recursively until no new source nodes are selected for processing.
        </p><p>
          Implementations are free to process the source document in any way that produces the same result as if it 
          were processed using this processing model.
        </p></td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> </td><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">XSLT 1.0, James Clark</span></td></tr></table></div><p>
        That doesn't solve all of our problems of course, but it's a start. Based on this we could imagine some form
        of JSLT code that might look like the following if we wanted to transform a simple DocBook document to 
        HTML.
      </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
          var sheet = require("jaspilite").sheet()
          ,   $     = require("jquery")
          ,   XL    = "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
          ;
          sheet.xmlns({
              "":   "http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
          ,   "xl": XL
          });
          sheet.template(":root &gt; article", function () {
              var title = $(this).find("info &gt; title").text();
              return $("&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;content/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;")
                        .find("title").text(title).end()
                        .find("h1").text(title).end()
                        .find("content").replaceWith($(this).apply());
          });
          sheet.template("info", function () {});
          sheet.template("section", function () {
              return $(this).apply().wrapIn("&lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;");
          });
          sheet.template("title", function () {
              var depth = $(this).parents("section").length;
              if (depth &lt; 1) return;
              depth++;
              if (depth &gt; 6) depth = 6;
              return $(this).apply().wrapIn(sheet.createElement("h" + depth));
          });
          sheet.template("para", function () {
              return $(this).apply().wrapIn("&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;");
          });
          sheet.template("emphasis", function () {
              return $(this).apply().wrapIn("&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;");
          });
          sheet.template("link[xl|href]", function () {
              var $link = $(this);
              return $link.apply().wrapIn("&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;").attr("href", $link[0].getAttributeNS(XL, "href"));
          });
          var $out = sheet.run("my-document.dkb");
          console.log($out.html());
        </pre></div><p>
        There are naturally some issues with the above code, but as a transformation sheet it is usable
        and ought to seem roughly familiar to JS developers in large part thanks to its reliance on jQuery.
        The first problem is namespaces: jQuery (and its underlying CSS engine, Sizzle) is not natively
        aware of namespaces. This can be worked around using a plugin, but it still shows when one tries
        to access a namespaced attribute. That being said, one thing that may not be readily obvious
        when used to XPath is that all of the CSS Selectors above use the DocBook namespace properly since
        unlike XPath CSS Selectors can have a default declaration applied to them.
      </p><p>
        Another issue is with injecting variables and finding a substitute for <code class="code">apply-templates</code>
        in the output tree. As can be seen in the first template, the way in which that is done is by first
        creating the output structure, and then addressing some of its part to inject a value or replace
        a dummy element. That may seem cumbersome, but jQuery makes it mercifully short. What's more, as
        can be seen in the other templates, all that's needed if one wishes to merely wrap the 
        <code class="code">apply-templates</code> in an element is to use the <code class="code">wrapIn()</code> method which will
        simply do the right thing.
      </p><p>
        Finally, the most likely limitation with this approach has to do with just how limited CSS Selectors
        are. For a trivial example they'll shine, but try so much as to find a text node and you'll hit a
        wall. This could be fixed either by inventing new selectors (which is not necessarily difficult
        since jQuery is very extensible in this area) or by making it possible to use XPath in the same
        context. The latter might be a workable option as a more power alternative that one can reach for
        when needed.
      </p><p>
        Of course this is just a thought experiment and it is likely to have many more failings. There is no
        doubt that the crafty minds of XSLT experts will be able to find many an XSLT construct that could be
        difficult to reproduce here. That said, crazier ideas have become popular.

        The XML ecosystem is big on validation, so big in fact that drinking games involving reciting long lists
        of validation technologies had to be banned after too many xml-dev subscribers were found suffering of
        delirium tremens.
      </p><p>
        On the HTML side however, there is not that much to be found. There are, naturally, a number of HTML
        validators out there, but they tend not to be easily extensible for the sort of context-specific
        rules that one may wish to overlay on HTML. JSON Schema is being worked on, but it applies only to JSON
        documents.
      </p><p>
        Naturally, a lot of the XML validation toolkit can be applied to HTML documents with some relatively
        manageable amount of shoe-horning. But most of it at best uses moving parts that are unfamiliar to most
        Web developers, and at worst is used as the boogeyman with which young web hackers are kept in check.
      </p><p>
        In the spirit of reusing good ideas across the cultural gap, one schema language that lends itself well
        both to the common validation problems in an HTML context (which are mostly validation overlaid atop
        HTML itself) and to concepts that can be translated with some degree of ease is Schematron.
      </p><p>
        Taking the basic notions of rules and assertions, we could imagine (again, as a thought experiment)
        a CSS Schema language that could look like the following:
      </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
          @rule head {
              title {
                  assert:  "Page does not have a title.";
              }
              link[rel="stylesheet"][type="text/css"][href="std.css"] {
                  assert:  "Page does not use the standard stylesheet.";
              }
              style {
                  report:  "Page uses inline style rather than linking.";
              }
          }
          @rule body {
              :scope.std-body {
                  assert:   "Page does not use the standard body class.";
              }
              :scope &gt; div.std-top {
                  assert:   "Page does not start with the required page top component.";
              }
          }
        </pre></div><p>
        The above is syntactically valid CSS that merely adds an <code class="code">@rule</code> block and new properties
        called <code class="code">assert</code> and <code class="code">report</code> that all correspond to the same constructs in Schematron.
        Selectors are used in the same manner that XPath is. Of note is the <code class="code">:scope</code> selector which
        can be used to select the current scope, matching the default context that XPath can use.
      </p><p>
        This can be used equally well offline or in a browser. One addition that could be interesting would be 
        simply to specify regular style properties (e.g. <code class="code">background: red;</code>) to the assertions so
        that when running in the browser the failure of an assertion would cause the style to be applied, making
        for nice visual feedback.
      </p><p>
        And since CSS can be applied interactively, this could notably be used in order to provide visual feedback
        inside browser-based document-editing systems.
